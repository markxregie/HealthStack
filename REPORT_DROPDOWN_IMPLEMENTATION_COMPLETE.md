# Report Dropdown Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary

The dropdown functionality for test names has been successfully implemented and is working correctly for all prescription IDs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Template Update (`templates/hospital_admin/create-report.html`)
- Replaced text input fields with select dropdowns for test names
- Populated dropdown options dynamically from available test names
- Set selected options based on current test name values
- Added JavaScript initialization for the `testNames` variable

### 2. View Update (`hospital_admin/views.py`)
- Added `test_names = Test_Information.objects.all()` to retrieve all available test names
- Added `test_names_json` context variable for JavaScript usage

## How It Works

1. **For Existing Tests**: The template displays existing tests with dropdowns pre-populated with all available test names, with the correct test name selected.

2. **For New Tests**: When the user clicks the "Add Test" button, JavaScript dynamically creates new test fields with dropdowns populated from the global `testNames` variable.

3. **Universal Functionality**: The dropdowns work for ALL prescription IDs because:
   - The view always retrieves all test names from the database
   - The JavaScript uses the global `testNames` variable that's populated for every page load
   - The template structure is the same for all prescription IDs

## User Instructions

1. **To see existing tests**: They appear automatically when the page loads
2. **To add new tests**: Click the "Add Test" button to see additional test fields with dropdowns
3. **For all prescription IDs**: The functionality works identically regardless of which prescription ID you're viewing

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and confirmed to work. The JavaScript console shows the test names being loaded correctly, and the dropdown functionality works as expected.

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
